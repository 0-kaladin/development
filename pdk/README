4) mkdir dist
   mkdir logs
   mkpdkcupcake.sh

(which contains: 

DT=`date +%y%m%d-%H%M%S`
#time make -j4 PRODUCT-generic-eng pdk dist DIST_DIR=dist 2>&1 | tee logs/$DT
time make -j4 pdk dist DIST_DIR=dist 2>&1 | tee logs/$DT

so you can see the results of the build in the logs directory.)

5) the pdk tar file is put in the dist directory.
