Using the Native Development Kit (NDK)
version 1.2

PRECONDITIONS

The Native Development Kit may be installed on either Linux or OS X.

The NDK must be installed on a case-sensitive file system. Linux
file systems are always case-sensitive, but the default OS X file
system is case-insenstive. A case-sensitive file sytem can be
created either by partitioning your drive to include a case-sensitive
partition or by creating a disk image that is case-sensitive.

STEP 1
Installing arm-eabi-gcc
-----------------------

1) Untar the android_ndk.tar.gz:

  tar -zxvf android_ndk.tar.gz

This will create a directory called ndk.  It should include a README file (this
file) and the following directories: config, include, lib, sample and toolchain.
  

STEP 2
Samples
-------

Look in the "samples" directory for samples of how to use the NDK.
