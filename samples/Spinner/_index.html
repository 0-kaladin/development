<p>
This sample is the application under test for the
<a href="../../../resources/tutorials/testing/activity_test.html">Activity
  Testing Tutorial</a>. It contains a single Activity that displays a
Spinner widget backed by an array of strings containing the names of the planets
in the Solar System. When an entry is selected from the Spinner, the entry is
displayed in a text box.
</p>
<p>
An important part of this application is state management. When the application
is first run, the spinner widget displays a default selection of
&quot;Earth&quot;. Thereafter, the application saves a selection as soon as it
is made. The application remembers the selection from invocation to invocation, even
if the device reboots.
</p>

For more information about this application, see the Activity Testing Tutorial.
The test application for this application is in the <a
  href="../SpinnerTest/index.html">SpinnerTest</a> sample application.
