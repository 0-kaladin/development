<p>A sample application that demonstrates Android's search framework.</p>

<p>This application includes a dictionary of words. By invoking the Android search dialog inside the
app (via the device search button or Menu > Search), you can perform a search
across the dictionary. As you type, suggestions will appear, which you can select
to view the complete definition. You can also execute the search to view all word definitions
that match the entered text.</p>

<p>The application also grants content provider privileges to 
Quick Search Box, Android's system-wide search tool. This means that the
dictionary definitions can be offered as search suggestions outside of the application,
when text is entered into Quick Search Box.</p>

<p>The code in this application demonstrates how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement a search interface using Android's search framework</li>
  <li>Provide custom search suggestions and offer them in Quick Search Box</li>
  <li>Create an FTS3 table in SQLite and perform full-text search</li>
  <li>Create a content provider to perform all searches and queries to the dictionary</li>
  <li>Use <a
href="../../../reference/android/widget/SimpleCursorAdapter.html">SimpleCursorAdapter</a> to bind
data from a Cursor to a ListView.</li>
</ul>
