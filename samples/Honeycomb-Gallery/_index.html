<p>This is a demo application highlighting how to use some of the new APIs in
Honeycomb, including Fragments, the Action Bar, drag'n drop, transition
animations, and a stack widget.  The image gallery shows how all these pieces
can work together in one application.</p>

<p>The application includes the following classes:<p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="src/com/example/android/hcgallery/ContentFragment.html">ContentFragment</a>
    A fragment responsible for containing the "content" of the application.
    Displays images, receives drag/drop events from other fragments.</li>
  <li><a href="src/com/example/android/hcgallery/TitlesFragment.html">TitlesFragment</a>
      Shows a ListView of photos to display in the ContentFragment. Photos can
      be chosen either by tapping on the listview, or dragging them from the
      list to the content area. The list of photos displayed depends on the
      category selected in the ActionBar.</li>
  <li><a href="src/com/example/android/hcgallery/MainActivity.html">MainActivity</a>
      This is the main entry point of the application. MainActivity is
      responsible for initialization of the ActionBar, TitlesFragment, and
      ContentFragment. MainActivity is also responsible for keeping track of
      the currently selected theme and currently selected photo when the
      activity is recreated, such as when the screen is rotated or an intent to
      a seperate activity is fired (such as the included Camera sample).
      MainActivity also contains code demonstrating how to animate
      showing/hiding fragments (in this case, the TitlesFragment) and the
      ActionBar, demonstrating how to smoothly transition between states
      in your application.</li>
  <li><a href="src/com/example/android/hcgallery/widget/WidgetProvider.html">WidgetProvider</a>
      The WidgetProvider class is an implementation of the AppWidgetProvider
      class, which is a view that can be embedded in other applications.
      This class is responsible for handling when the instance of this widget
      is enabled, disabled, created, deleted, or updated.</li>
  <li><a href="src/com/example/android/hcgallery/widget/WidgetService.html">WidgetService</a>
      The WidgetService is an implementation of the RemoteViewsService class,
      which is used to populate the collection view (in this case, a stack
      widget)</li> </ul>
