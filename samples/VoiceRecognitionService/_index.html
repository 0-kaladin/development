<p>A sample application that demonstrates Android's pluggable voice recognition framework.</p>

<p>This application includes a sample voice recognition service, and a settings activity
for that service. It shows the basic skeleton for setting up a recognition service and
exposing its settings activity to settings.</p>

<p>The behavior is extremely simple - it does no real voice recognition, and just returns a
fixed set of results immediately. The results can be either a set of letters or numbers, as
chosen by the user in the simplistic settings activity.</p>
