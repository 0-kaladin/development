<h2>NotePad Documentation</h2>
<p>
    NotePad is a simple application for entering and saving character-only notes.
    It demonstrates the following Android concepts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ListView objects with Cursor-based adapters.</li>
    <li>Data storage and access with a ContentProvider.</li>
    <li>Intent filters that handle multiple actions.</li>
    <li>Activity objects that handle more than one Intent.</li>
    <li>Sending an Intent by selecting an item from a ListView.</li>
    <li>Sending data in an Intent.</li>
    <li>Dynamic construction of menus.</li>
    <li>Context menus.</li>
    <li>Providing other applications as alternative actions for a data item.</li>
    <li>Creating <a href="../../../reference/android/provider/LiveFolders.html">
    Live Folders</a></li>
    <li>Setting up an application that does not use "save" or "exit". The application
    saves the user's work whenever focus moves to another task. It remains available until
    the system destroys it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>
    By default, NotePad displays a list of existing notes,
    and provides a menu that allows you to insert a new note. If you click an existing note, you
    can edit it, or select the menu to delete it or edit its title. If you context-click an
    existing note, you can also delete it. If you navigate away from a new note once you've entered
    text, NotePad automatically saves what you've entered.
</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>
    NotePad has limited functionality. It does not provide search/replace. It does not support
    HTML or any other type of markup. However, it does have copy/paste if it is running on a
    version of the Android platform that supports that functionality.
</p>
<h4>Provider</h4>
<p>
    Other applications can use NotePad's content provider to store notes. The "contract" for
    the NotePad provider is documented in the Appendix.
</p>
<h4>Alternative actions</h4>
<p>
    Other applications can also register themselves to handle NotePad notes. To do this, they must
    provide the necessary specifications in their manifest file. The specifications are listed in
    the Appendix.
</p>
<h4>Test package</h4>
<p>
    This sample also contains a test package that demonstrates how to test a ContentProvider and
    an Activity. To learn more about this test package, please read
    <a href="tests/index.html">NotePadTest Documentation</a>

<p class="note">
    Please notice that this is not the same code that's used for the
    <a href="../../../guide/tutorials/notepad/index.html">Notepad Tutorial</a>. This code has been
    updated more recently, and the tutorial is a more simple implementation. If you're new to
    Android development, you should start with the tutorial, then return to this code.
