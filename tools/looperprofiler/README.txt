LooperProfiler is a simple tool to convert and display looper traces.
7/15/2011

Note: LooperProfiler is a crude tool and needs more work.

Looper traces are generated by invoking ViewDebug.startLooperProfiling()
and ViewDebug.stopLooperProfiling().

After profiling the file must be pulled from the device using adb pull.

To use this tool, compile the single .java file and run:
java LooperTraceToTraceView myLooperTracesFile looperTraceViewFile

The run traceview looperTraceViewFile
